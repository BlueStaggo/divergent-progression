Divergent Progression is a mod that alters the way Minecraft's progression works inspired by [Minecraft Diverge](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/MCDiverge) and [Slow Your Roll](https://modrinth.com/mod/slow-your-roll/). Wooden and stone tools are no longer craftable and flint and copper tools take their places instead. Tool and armor recipes have been altered to be significantly more expensive and the durability system has been given some tweaks.

## Features
- Flint and copper tools in place of wooden and stone tools
- Flint pebbles generate all over the overworld
- Added bars crafted from 6 of a material which are used for tool crafting, crafted like rails but rotated and without the stick
- Anvils are now crafted with 4 bars and 3 ingots in place of 3 blocks and 4 ingots
- Chainmail armor is craftable instead of iron armor; other armor can be crafted by smithing chainmail armor with their respective bars
- Tools and armor no longer get destroyed upon breaking and instead simply become useless amidst the ongoing tool preservation crisis (armor trims, you're not helping)
- Unit repairs at anvils are free and anvils break slightly less often
- Durability for vanilla tool materials have been buffed
- Smelting iron and gold tools results in ingots instead of nuggets
